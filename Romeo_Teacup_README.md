ROMEO TEACUP
Romeo_Teacup is a website designed to advertise and showcase a Pomeranian dog called Romeo in the best and most professional way by providing as much information to incite visitors to make contact via the site for new bookings for film, photography and advertising work. 
Fans of Romeo can find all his social media platforms from the site and there are links to Romeo’s external merchandise shop, so that visitors can click through, view the shop and buy merchandise using the discount code provided on the site. This is a way of giving back and saying thank you for visiting the site. As well as acting as an incentive to check out his merchandise store and receive a discount.

UX Process

Product definition
I would like to create a website that acts as a hub of information on everything to do with Romeo the Pomeranian. Romeo already has a Shopify store called RomesCloset that is a dog boutique dedicated to selling online items for dogs. However I want a separate website that provides detailed information on Romeo the Pomeranian for people interested in hiring a dog and for fans of Romeo. This website will be included on his business cards to be given out to members of the public that want or need further information on Romeo. Business cards are given out at dog events Romeo attends and to anyone that would like to hire Romeo for creative projects. This website will bring together all information on Romeos work, activities and shop in one place and gives the user the ability to make contact via email and/or visit the shop through the links provided which hopefully will turn into sales.
product research. I conducted research by searching other animals that have their own website for an idea of how the competition illustrate their content and what type of information was included. I also took a look at other social influencers (to include humans) for inspiration on aspects of their website that kept me on the website and sustained my engagement. This was useful for my project in terms of generating ideas for example on which colours to use across the website for my target audience, which bits of information to present first, and allowing me to compare and distinguish Romeo’s strengths so I can emphasis and illustrate that clearly on my website.

User Role-play Analysis
As a casting agent for a new commercial, I want to find out what previous work the dog has done, the dogs measurements and see as many photos as possible.
As a dog lover I want to see more photos and videos of the dog by way of obtaining all social media information. 
As a dog owner, I want to find out where Romeo gets most of his clothes from and buy something similar for my dog but they didn’t know Romeo had his own dog boutique.
As the director of a new dog company, I want to find out whereabouts in the UK Romeo is based as I am looking for cute dog ambassadors that require little training to attend events.
As a music manager I saw Romeo and was given a business card that had www.romeoteacup.com website on it. I’m looking for cute dog for a video shoot and need to find out Romeo’s location and availability.
As magazine editor I want to do a piece on Romeo and would like to find out more information about him such as age and see more of his talent and skills.
As a dog groomer who saw Romeo at a show, I want to invite you to come to our groomers for a free haircut to promote their store on his instagram.


Home Page
Feature: Home Page
Romeos best feature is his good youthful look so I will be using a single large photo of Romeo with text overlay as the Home page for dramatic effect. I currently am using a stock photo whilst I decide on the best photo of Rome to use. The Navbar, Logo and Footer are the only other items on the page.

Feature: Navbar
I took a Navbar from Bootstrap 4 and customised to my preferences. I wanted a cool looking Navbar rather than the default Navbar light so I added a gradient to create a small amount of transparency. Navbar items are aligned to the right and included a logo.

Feature: Logo
I had a customised logo that I included in my NAVBAR and gave it a height of 100cm to appear on the page as I would like.

Feature: Footer
I created an original footer to include all the social media links I would like to user to view connecting directly to Romeo related social media pages. Facebook, Instragram, Twitter, Youtube.         I also added a copyright label at the bottom.

About Page
Feature: About Me
The about me section gives users the chance to find out about all of Romeos work experience, likes/dislikes and location etc.

Feature: Measurements
The measurement section was divided into 2 columns with a photo illustrating a dog being measured alongside a list of Romeo’s measurements. This is vital information to people who may want to book Romeo for work, therefore I created this section to stand alone and positioned it near the about me section at the top of the page as I want the information to be clearly visible to the user.

Social Media Page
Feature: Tik-tok
I included 2 videos as an example of the type of content Romeo has on the platform so people can see it and hopefully go on the site and watch more of his content.

Feature: Instagram
I would like to include 6 photographs from Romeos instagram but have not yet decided which photographs to select, so I have used 3 stock photos 6 times for illustration purposes until I can include Romeos original photographs.

Romescloset Shop Page
Feature: Romescloset Banner
The Romescloset shop page was created using a Jumbotron from Bootstrap4 and customised to my specification. I have used a stock photo until I decide on which original photograph to use.  The aim of this page is to provide an external link to a dog boutique owned by Romeo that sells dog clothes and accessories. Visitors of this site will have an interest in dogs or own a dog themselves, therefore I wanted to use this site created to provide information as a way to advertise the shop and use it as a secondary way to driving more traffic to www.romescloset.com.
Feature: Discount-code
The discount code section allows all visitors of the site to obtain a discount code to be used on an external site www.romescloset.com where all his merchandise is sold. I used a button that has a modal pop up revealing a unique discount code the user can use. The user can click through the visit site button on the page to be redirected to the shop. The intention is that this will work as an incentive for visitors of the site to visit Romeo’s store and use the discount code. It also acts as a reward for visitors for checking out the site www.romeoteacup.com. The discount code is positioned at the top of the page so it is the first thing that is read, just above the Romescloset Jumbotron.

Contact Page
I added a contact page as a way for the user to make contact with us via the website. Each box requires and answer illustrated by the red mandatory marks.

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea I would like to include in the future is the ability to request a shout out from Romeo similar to the site cameo.  The user can state what they would like written on a sign with a picture of Romeo in it & send the picture to the address or email of the user as a souvenir, present, etc.

CSS
The project uses CSS to style the original HTML Code & Bootstrap to my own preference. A stylesheet was created and inserted in the code.

BOOTSTRAP4
https://getbootstrap.com/
The project uses Bootstrap4 Templates for the initial creation of the NAVBAR, Jumbotron.

Color Tool
https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0
Used to pick the colour scheme for the overall website to include page background colours, buttons, footer and navigation bar .

https://fontawesome.com/
The project uses Font Awesome to include Social media and Navbar icons and customise the overall font style

Validator
https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea
The project used a code validator to ensure the code worked properly with no faults.


Testing
I tested all my html codes for each sepreate page using a html validator called Nu Html Checker and made the necessary corrections. 
Home Page Testing
NAVBAR sticks to the top and all Navbar item link's work correctly.
The zoom animation of the Home Page Image is working 
Footer works and connects to the right links.

About page Testing:
Information is displayed correctly, in the right position and correct colours and the image is the correct size and in the right position.

Social-Media Page:
The images are diplayed clearly in the correct position and size.
The videos work when the user clicks the play button on the TikTok videos.

Shop page Testing:
Go to the "Shop" page
Click discount code large button
Pop up appears showing unique discount code.
Click close.
The discount code button works displaying the pop up modal with the discount code as text when the user clicks the large button.

Go to the "Shop" page
Click Visit Store button
New store loads.
The jumbatron image and text is diplayed correctly. The Visit Store button works and connects to external site as desired.

Contact form page Testing:
Unfortunately when I try to submit the form with all inputs valid, the form returns an error message that appears even if completed correctly and I think this is due to not having a database to hold the information submitted.
When I try to submit the form with an invalid email address the same error page appears as above that reads "The site configured at this address does not contain the requested file."
However if you go to the "Contact Us" page and try to submit the empty form there is an error message about the required fields appears that reads "Please fill in this field"

I have had issues making the site mobile responsive and have found this the most difficult part of the project. But the site looks great on desktop and IPAD sized screens.


Deployment
I deplyoyed the project using GitHub by going to the correct repositry and clicking on settings. On the next screen I scrolled down to the Github pages 
and for the source I selected the MASTER Branch. The page reloaded then I selected the option in Github pages that became available that reads "your site is ready to be published".
Upon revieweing the details in the settings it now reads  Your site is published at https://kimberleychi.github.io/Romeo-Teacup-Submission/.
I didnt experience any difficulties deploying the project and the deployed version and the development version are exactly the same as desired.
